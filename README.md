# SimpleOS
Implementation of a simple Operating system for x86 architecture. Part of CSCE611 course at Texas A &amp; M

Each Machine Problem adds with a specific new feature to the kernel

MP1 : Simple Hello world kernel program. Integration of gdb debugger with bochs emulator

MP2 : Implemeted a Frame Manager for physical memory management

MP3 : Implemented a paging mechanism for memory management

MP4 : Extended support for virtual memory and implemented a virtual memory allocator

MP5 : Implemented a Kernel level thread scheduling support

MP6 : Implemented a simple non blocking device driver for HardDisk

MP7 : Designed a Simple FileSystem


Each Machine Problem (MP) folder contains a "dev_kernel_grub.img" file which contains the image of kernel which included the feature implemented in that MP

The image can be boot through a virutal box or any other virtual machine manager.
